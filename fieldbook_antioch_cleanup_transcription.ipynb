In July 1967, he was convicted in Italy of receiving looted artefacts, though in the same year he met and became an important supplier of antiquities to US dealer Robert Hecht (Silver 2009: 27-9). In 1968, Medici opened the gallery Antiquaria Romana in Rome and began to explore business opportunities in Switzerland (Silver 2009: 34). It is widely believed that in December 1971 he bought the illegally-excavated Euphronios (Sarpedon) krater from tombaroli before transporting it to Switzerland and selling it to Hecht (Silver 2009: 50). In September 1995, the Italian Carabinieri, in conjunction with Swiss police, raided Italian antiquities dealer Giacomo Medici’s storerooms in Geneva Freeport. The raids on Medici’s storerooms were part of a wide-ranging investigation into the antiquities trade out of Italy, and more raids followed in 2001 on US dealer Robert Hecht’s apartment in Paris and in 2002 and 2005 on Italian dealer Gianfranco Becchina’s premises in Basel. The evidence collected during the course of the Italian investigation caused several US art museums to return material to Italy, including the Cleveland Museum of Art. As long ago as 1973, Cleveland’s then-curator of ancient art John Cooney had expressed his belief that ninety-five percent of material in the United States had been ‘smuggled in’, adding that even for ‘hot’ objects, he was only concerned to verify their legal entry into the United States, identifying Switzerland as a point of transit (Shirey 1973). Cooney described Hecht as ‘always meticulous and upright’, with ‘one of the best eyes in the business’, adding that he never asked Hecht for documents of provenance—he thought it would be ridiculous (Shirey 1973).\n","END\n","\n","OUTPUT:\n","\n","CREATE (p1:PERSON {personName:'Giacomo Medici',type:'dealer'})\n","CREATE (p2:PERSON {personName:'Gianfranco Becchina',type:'dealer'})\n","CREATE

In July 1967, he was convicted in Italy of receiving looted artefacts, though in the same year he met and became an important supplier of antiquities to US dealer Robert Hecht (Silver 2009: 27-9). In 1968, Medici opened the gallery Antiquaria Romana in Rome and began to explore business opportunities in Switzerland (Silver 2009: 34). It is widely believed that in December 1971 he bought the illegally-excavated Euphronios (Sarpedon) krater from tombaroli before transporting it to Switzerland and selling it to Hecht (Silver 2009: 50). In September 1995, the Italian Carabinieri, in conjunction with Swiss police, raided Italian antiquities dealer Giacomo Medici’s storerooms in Geneva Freeport. The raids on Medici’s storerooms were part of a wide-ranging investigation into the antiquities trade out of Italy, and more raids followed in 2001 on US dealer Robert Hecht’s apartment in Paris and in 2002 and 2005 on Italian dealer Gianfranco Becchina’s premises in Basel. The evidence collected during the course of the Italian investigation caused several US art museums to return material to Italy, including the Cleveland Museum of Art. As long ago as 1973, Cleveland’s then-curator of ancient art John Cooney had expressed his belief that ninety-five percent of material in the United States had been ‘smuggled in’, adding that even for ‘hot’ objects, he was only concerned to verify their legal entry into the United States, identifying Switzerland as a point of transit (Shirey 1973). Cooney described Hecht as ‘always meticulous and upright’, with ‘one of the best eyes in the business’, adding that he never asked Hecht for documents of provenance—he thought it would be ridiculous (Shirey 1973).\n","END\n","\n","OUTPUT:\n","\n","CREATE (p1:PERSON {personName:'Giacomo Medici',type:'dealer'})\n","CREATE (p2:PERSON {personName:'Gianfranco Becchina',type:'dealer'})\n","CREATE (p3:PERSON {personName:'John Cooney',type:'curator'})\n","CREATE (p4:PERSON {personName:'Robert Hecht',type:'dealer'})\n","CREATE (o1:ORGANIZATION {orgName:'Italian Carabinieri',type:'police'})\n","CREATE (o2:ORGANIZATION {orgName:'Cleveland Art Museum',type:'museum'})\n","CREATE(l1:PLACE{placeName:'Geneva',type:'city'})\n","CREATE(l2:PLACE{placeName:'Basel',type:'city'})\n","CREATE(l3:PLACE{placeName:'Italy',type:'country'})\n","CREATE(l4:PLACE{placeName:'Medici storerooms',type:'crime scene'})\n","\n","MATCH (a {orgName:'Italian Carabinieri'}), (b {placeName:'Medici storerooms'}) MERGE (a)-[:RAIDED]->(b);\n","MATCH (a {placeName:'Medici storerooms'}), (b {placeName:'Geneva'}) MERGE (a)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(b);\n","MATCH (a {orgName:'Italian Carabinieri'}), (b {personName:'Gianfranco Becchina'}) MERGE (a)-[:RAIDED]->(b);\n","MATCH (a {personName:'Gianfranco Becchina'}), (b {placeName:'Basel'}) MERGE (a)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(b);\n","MATCH (a {orgName:'Cleveland Art Museum'}), (b {placeName:'Italy'}) MERGE (a)-[:RETURNED_ARTIFACTS_TO]->(b);\n","MATCH (a {personName:'Giacomo Medici'}), (b {placeName:'Medici storerooms'}) MERGE (a)-[:OWNED]->(b);\n","MATCH (a {personName:'John Cooney'}), (b {orgName:'Cleveland Art Museum'}) MERGE (a)-[:CURATOR_OF]->(b);\n","MATCH (a {personName:'Giacomo Medici'}), (b {personName:'Robert Hecht'}) MERGE (a)-[:SOLD_TO]->(b);\n","a. a.

length: 3957 prompt: (below)\n","Medici started dealing in antiquities in Rome during the 1960s (Silver 2009: 25). In July 1967, he was convicted in Italy of receiving looted artefacts, though in the same year he met and became an important supplier of antiquities to US dealer Robert Hecht (Silver 2009: 27-9). In 1968, Medici opened the gallery Antiquaria Romana in Rome and began to explore business opportunities in Switzerland (Silver 2009: 34). It is widely believed that in December 1971 he bought the illegally-excavated Euphronios (Sarpedon) krater from tombaroli before transporting it to Switzerland and selling it to Hecht (Silver 2009: 50). In September 1995, the Italian Carabinieri, in conjunction with Swiss police, raided Italian antiquities dealer Giacomo Medici’s storerooms in Geneva Freeport. The raids on Medici’s storerooms were part of a wide-ranging investigation into the antiquities trade out of Italy, and more raids followed in 2001 on US dealer Robert Hecht’s apartment in Paris and in 2002 and 2005 on Italian dealer Gianfranco Becchina’s premises in Basel. The evidence collected during the course of the Italian investigation caused several US art museums to return material to Italy, including the Cleveland Museum of Art. As long ago as 1973, Cleveland’s then-curator of ancient art John Cooney had expressed his belief that ninety-five percent of material in the United States had been ‘smuggled in’, adding that even for ‘hot’ objects, he was only concerned to verify their legal entry into the United States, identifying Switzerland as a point of transit (Shirey 1973). Cooney described Hecht as ‘always meticulous and upright’, with ‘one of the best eyes in the business’, adding that he never asked Hecht for documents of provenance—he thought it would be ridiculous (Shirey 1973).\n","END\n","\n","OUTPUT:\n","\n","CREATE (p1:PERSON {personName:'Giacomo Medici',type:'dealer'})\n","CREATE (p2:PERSON {personName:'Gianfranco Becchina',type:'dealer'})\n","CREATE (p3:PERSON {personName:'John Cooney',type:'curator'})\n","CREATE (p4:PERSON {personName:'Robert Hecht',type:'dealer'})\n","CREATE (o1:ORGANIZATION {orgName:'Italian Carabinieri',type:'police'})\n","CREATE (o2:ORGANIZATION {orgName:'Cleveland Art Museum',type:'museum'})\n","CREATE(l1:PLACE{placeName:'Geneva',type:'city'})\n","CREATE(l2:PLACE{placeName:'Basel',type:'city'})\n","CREATE(l3:PLACE{placeName:'Italy',type:'country'})\n","CREATE(l4:PLACE{placeName:'Medici storerooms',type:'crime scene'})\n","\n","MATCH (a {orgName:'Italian Carabinieri'}), (b {placeName:'Medici storerooms'}) MERGE (a)-[:RAIDED]->(b);\n","MATCH (a {placeName:'Medici storerooms'}), (b {placeName:'Geneva'}) MERGE (a)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(b);\n","MATCH (a {orgName:'Italian Carabinieri'}), (b {personName:'Gianfranco Becchina'}) MERGE (a)-[:RAIDED]->(b);\n","MATCH (a {personName:'Gianfranco Becchina'}), (b {placeName:'Basel'}) MERGE (a)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(b);\n","MATCH (a {orgName:'Cleveland Art Museum'}), (b {placeName:'Italy'}) MERGE (a)-[:RETURNED_ARTIFACTS_TO]->(b);\n","MATCH (a {personName:'Giacomo Medici'}), (b {placeName:'Medici storerooms'}) MERGE (a)-[:OWNED]->(b);\n","MATCH (a {personName:'John Cooney'}), (b {orgName:'Cleveland Art Museum'}) MERGE (a)-[:CURATOR_OF]->(b);\n","MATCH (a {personName:'Giacomo Medici'}), (b {personName:'Robert Hecht'}) MERGE (a)-[:SOLD_TO]->(b);\n","1932\n","\n","extension .\n","blocks above rubble\n","suter\n","of outer foundation\n","Followed along outer\n","to the wmich .

ANT_FB_1932-002-0001_p2.jpg page 2 of 2\n","my_prompt's length: 3393 prompt: (below)\n","Medici started dealing in antiquities in Rome during the 1960s (Silver 2009: 25). In July 1967, he was convicted in Italy of receiving looted artefacts, though in the same year he met and became an important supplier of antiquities to US dealer Robert Hecht (Silver 2009: 27-9). In 1968, Medici opened the gallery Antiquaria Romana in Rome and began to explore business opportunities in Switzerland (Silver 2009: 34). It is widely believed that in December 1971 he bought the illegally-excavated Euphronios (Sarpedon) krater from tombaroli before transporting it to Switzerland and selling it to Hecht (Silver 2009: 50). In September 1995, the Italian Carabinieri, in conjunction with Swiss police, raided Italian antiquities dealer Giacomo Medici’s storerooms in Geneva Freeport. The raids on Medici’s storerooms were part of a wide-ranging investigation into the antiquities trade out of Italy, and more raids followed in 2001 on US dealer Robert Hecht’s apartment in Paris and in 2002 and 2005 on Italian dealer Gianfranco Becchina’s premises in Basel. The evidence collected during the course of the Italian investigation caused several US art museums to return material to Italy, including the Cleveland Museum of Art. As long ago as 1973, Cleveland’s then-curator of ancient art John Cooney had expressed his belief that ninety-five percent of material in the United States had been ‘smuggled in’, adding that even for ‘hot’ objects, he was only concerned to verify their legal entry into the United States, identifying Switzerland as a point of transit (Shirey 1973). Cooney described Hecht as ‘always meticulous and upright’, with ‘one of the best eyes in the business’, adding that he never asked Hecht for documents of provenance—he thought it would be ridiculous (Shirey 1973).\n","END\n","\n","OUTPUT:\n","\n","CREATE (p1:PERSON {personName:'Giacomo Medici',type:'dealer'})\n","CREATE (p2:PERSON {personName:'Gianfranco Becchina',type:'dealer'})\n","CREATE (p3:PERSON {personName:'John Cooney',type:'curator'})\n","CREATE (p4:PERSON {personName:'Robert Hecht',type:'dealer'})\n","CREATE (o1:ORGANIZATION {orgName:'Italian Carabinieri',type:'police'})\n","CREATE (o2:ORGANIZATION {orgName:'Cleveland Art Museum',type:'museum'})\n","CREATE(l1:PLACE{placeName:'Geneva',type:'city'})\n","CREATE(l2:PLACE{placeName:'Basel',type:'city'})\n","CREATE(l3:PLACE{placeName:'Italy',type:'country'})\n","CREATE(l4:PLACE{placeName:'Medici storerooms',type:'crime scene'})\n","\n","MATCH (a {orgName:'Italian Carabinieri'}), (b {placeName:'Medici storerooms'}) MERGE (a)-[:RAIDED]->(b);\n","MATCH (a {placeName:'Medici storerooms'}), (b {placeName:'Geneva'}) MERGE (a)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(b);\n","MATCH (a {orgName:'Italian Carabinieri'}), (b {personName:'Gianfranco Becchina'}) MERGE (a)-[:RAIDED]->(b);\n","MATCH (a {personName:'Gianfranco Becchina'}), (b {placeName:'Basel'}) MERGE (a)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(b);\n","MATCH (a {orgName:'Cleveland Art Museum'}), (b {placeName:'Italy'}) MERGE (a)-[:RETURNED_ARTIFACTS_TO]->(b);\n","MATCH (a {personName:'Giacomo Medici'}), (b {placeName:'Medici storerooms'}) MERGE (a)-[:OWNED]->(b);\n","MATCH (a {personName:'John Cooney'}), (b {orgName:'Cleveland Art Museum'}) MERGE (a)-[:CURATOR_OF]->(b);\n","MATCH (a {personName:'Giacomo Medici'}), (b {personName:'Robert Hecht'}) MERGE (a)-[:SOLD_TO]->(b);\n","3\n","serrated ferdes\n","مالسهم التنمية fat سلبية : 4غيلة سيلة\n","lancing quit\n","them red\n","gil pinonething on twoo to night & studing factouring will\n","Dancing youch\n","\n","==================================\n","3\n","serrated ferdes\n","مالسهم التنمية fat سلبية : 4غيلة سيلة\n","lancing quit\n","them red\n","gil pinonething on twoo to night & studing factouring will\n","Dancing youch\n","==================================\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%%html\n","<!-- Thanks to https://gist.github.com/bollwyvl/e51b4e724f0b82669c84 -->\n","<script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js\"></script>\n","<script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mermaid/9.1.7/mermaid.min.js\" integrity=\"sha512-1ypa9tdUrJAWv5g28Mb5x0zXaUuI4SBofKff88OGyk5D/oOd4x1IPxYHsx3K81bwBKt8NVUvGgw7TgNZ6PJX2A==\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\"></script>\n","<style>\n","    .mermaid *{font-family: sans-serif;
