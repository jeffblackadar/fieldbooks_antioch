# fieldbooks_antioch

This program transcribes images of a handwritten fieldbook into text. It does it with three different services:

+ Microsoft Azure Cognititive Services
+ Amazon Web Services
+ Google Cloud Platform.

The results are stored in a [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RJIX6HDAOfD1GObbu1wJOo-gOlRG3uWwG0JM_iQWdA8/edit?usp=sharing).

There is a [blog post](https://jeffblackadar.ca/uncategorized/handwriting-transcription-of-a-fieldbook-with-microsofts-azure-cognitive-services-and-amazons-aws-textract/) about this process.
